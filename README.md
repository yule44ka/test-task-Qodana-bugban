# Bugban Analyzer
#### How to run:
1) Run **BugbanAnalyzer.java** (located here: *src/main/java/org/example/BugbanAnalyzer.java*).
2) Specify paths for first file, second file, output for problems only in first file, output for problems only in second file andoutput for problems in both files.

I prepared files that can be used for testing, they are located in *src/test/java/org/example*.
